## About Laravel | Laravel is overrated

Laravel is a web application framework with complex syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling ha ha ha ha. Laravel creates the true pain of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkE45O4BY28), Ooowww come on fast simple routing???
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkE45O4BY28), Why so much dependency in the frist place??
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkE45O4BY28) storage, Thank you for turning two lines of code to thousands lines of useless code.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkE45O4BY28), So much that half of queries are Raw.
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkE45O4BY28), Come on even early humans auto generated migration files.
- [Robust background job processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkE45O4BY28), Did you heard about the message queueing??
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkE45O4BY28), Thank you for bringing Frontend patterns to Backend.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications, ok bye.  
Using Laravel for large products is like digging your grave by your own hands.  

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has a bad [documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkE45O4BY28) and some video tutorial library like all modern web application frameworks, making it a pain to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkE45O4BY28) can help, yep I knew, laravel developers dont like to read. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
